# pet-seeker
WDI9 Project 4 submission

This is the front-end component to my Project 4 submission for the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly in DC.

The Rails API for serving the data to this app can be found here:
https://github.com/lelandjordon/pet-seeker-api

This app was written primarily with AngularJS, and its appearance and functions will evolve over time (hopefully for the better).
