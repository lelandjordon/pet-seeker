# pet-seeker
WDI9 Project 4 submission

This is the front-end component to my Project 4 submission for the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly in DC.

The live site is here:
http://lelandjordon.github.io/pet-seeker/

The Rails API for serving the data to this app can be found here:
https://github.com/lelandjordon/pet-seeker-api

This app was written primarily with AngularJS, and its appearance and functions will evolve over time (hopefully for the better).

The plan was to use a public API to search pet shelters for adoptable pets.  I had
attempted to find a particular dog in the past, but was stymied by the task of
searching a disorganized variety of municipal and nonprofit shelters.

I wrote my API to serve my own data until I can make good use of one of the few
publicly available APIs.
